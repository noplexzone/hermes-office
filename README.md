Watch Jarvis, delegated workers, and local coding agents work in a living pixel village.

Hermes Office is a Hermes-first mission-control fork of ClaudeVille. It reads Hermes profile databases and supported coding-CLI session stores read-only, normalizes them into one session model, and renders active agents as either an isometric RPG village or a dense monitoring dashboard.

- **Local and read-only:** no hosted service, no telemetry, no provider-file writes.
- **Hermes-first and multi-provider:** named Hermes profiles plus Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Grok CLI, Kimi, OpenCode, and OMP.
- **Glanceable:** World mode for second-monitor awareness; Dashboard mode for exact state.
- **Zero-build runtime:** Node HTTP/WebSocket server plus static browser assets.

Current inherited version: **v0.33.3**. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for named releases and user-facing changes.

Hermes Office is maintained at `noplexzone/hermes-office` as a downstream fork of `TokenBrice/claude-ville`. The MIT license and upstream attribution are retained; the inherited renderer and adapters remain available while Hermes is the primary coordinator and data source.

## Why Hermes Office

Hermes Office turns invisible multi-agent project work into a place Caleb can leave open. Jarvis and temporary workers move through the village according to real activity, while Dashboard mode keeps exact provider, model, project, token, tool, status, and session detail available when needed.

The app is intentionally small: a zero-dependency Node.js HTTP/WebSocket server, static browser assets, vanilla ES modules, and Canvas 2D rendering.

## Local And Read-Only

Hermes Office binds to the IPv4 loopback interface at `localhost:4000` by default and reads Hermes/profile and supported CLI session stores from the machine. Container deployments can set `HERMES_OFFICE_HOST=0.0.0.0`; non-local browser hostnames remain rejected unless their exact `host:port` is listed in `HERMES_OFFICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. It does not write provider databases or session files, does not proxy requests to a hosted service, and does not need a build step to run.

Desktop browser viewports 1280px wide and larger are the supported target. Empty provider lists are normal on machines where no supported CLI has local session files yet.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Local source |
| --- | --- |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/state.db` and `~/.hermes/profiles/*/state.db` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/` |
| Grok CLI | `~/.grok/sessions/` |
| Kimi | `~/.kimi/` and `~/.kimi-code/` |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` |

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4000`.

### Container development image

The CI workflow publishes `noplexzone/hermes-office:develop` plus an immutable `sha-<commit>` tag from the `develop` branch. `docker-compose.yml` mounts the Hermes install read-only at `/hermes`, runs with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities, and leaves non-local host access opt-in:
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the example Hermes path and browser host, or provide the same values inline:

```bash
HERMES_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/.hermes \
HERMES_OFFICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=tower.local:4000 \
docker compose up -d
```

Use the exact browser `host:port` in `HERMES_OFFICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`; comma-separate multiple values. The application never accepts a wildcard trusted host. Set `HERMES_OFFICE_PROFILES=jarvis` (the Compose default) to scan only the named agents that belong in this office; omit it to discover every profile.

For private local theme packs, set `HERMES_OFFICE_LOCAL_ASSET_ROOT` to an existing absolute directory. The server exposes that directory read-only at `/local-assets/` while retaining real-path containment checks; leave the variable unset to disable the mount. Container deployments must additionally mount the host directory into the container and set the variable to that in-container path.

Runtime is dependency-free: `npm run dev` uses only Node built-ins and static browser files. The repo also has a `package-lock.json` and dev dependencies for sprite validation, visual diffs, and Playwright-based capture scripts; run `npm install` only when those development scripts are needed.

Common `package.json` scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start `claudeville/server.js` on port `4000`. |
| `npm run validate:quick` | Run the no-runtime syntax, adapter-fixture, git-event, unit-test, and sprite-ID checks. |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run the `node:test` cases in `scripts/tests/` (status derivation, session residency, chronicle, spend ledger). |
| `npm run check:server` / `check:adapters` / `check:services` / `check:frontend-syntax` / `check:scripts` | Targeted JavaScript syntax checks. |
| `npm run check:git-events` | Validate git-event parsing fixtures. |
| `npm run check:adapter-fixtures` | Validate adapter fixture behavior. |
| `npm run sprites:audit-ids` | Check renderer sprite references against the manifest. |
| `npm run sprites:audit-refresh` | Run sprite ID audit and full manifest validation together. |
| `npm run sprites:validate` | Validate `assets/sprites/manifest.yaml` against PNG files and character-sheet shape. Requires dev dependencies. |
| `npm run sprites:capture-baseline` | Capture baseline world screenshots for sprite visual diffing. Requires the dev server and Playwright. |
| `npm run sprites:capture-fresh` | Capture fresh screenshots next to the baseline set. Requires the dev server and Playwright. |
| `npm run sprites:visual-diff` | Compare baseline and fresh sprite screenshots with `pixelmatch`. Requires dev dependencies. |
| `npm run world:validate-buildings` | Validate building definitions, entrances, visit tiles, walk exclusions, and manifest references. |
| `npm run world:validate-terrain` | Validate terrain chunk/cache sizing guardrails. |

## Fast Onboarding Path

For an unfamiliar agent, read these first:

1. `README.md` for the app shape, commands, API surface, and docs map.
2. `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` for repo workflow, shared-checkout rules, validation, and known pitfalls.
3. `claudeville/CLAUDE.md` for implementation-level architecture inside the app.
4. `docs/README.md` for the current task-oriented documentation map.
5. `agents/README.md` before using or adding retained agent artifacts.
6. The area README for the slice you are editing:
   - `claudeville/adapters/README.md` for provider parsing and normalized session contracts.
   - `claudeville/src/presentation/character-mode/README.md` for World mode.
   - `claudeville/src/presentation/dashboard-mode/README.md` for Dashboard mode.
   - `claudeville/src/presentation/shared/README.md` for shared UI and detail fetches.
   - `scripts/sprites/generate.md` for sprite generation and validation.

## Requirements

- Desktop browser at 1280px wide or larger. Mobile and narrow viewports are out of scope.
- Node.js 22.13 or newer (`node:sqlite` is available without a runtime flag).
- `npm install` only for dev scripts that import packages (`js-yaml`, `pngjs`, `pixelmatch`, `playwright`). The server itself does not need installed packages.
- At least one local provider home directory:
  - Hermes Agent: `~/.hermes/state.db` and `~/.hermes/profiles/*/state.db`
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude/`
  - Codex CLI: `~/.codex/` (sessions are read from `~/.codex/sessions/`)
  - Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/` (sessions are read from `~/.gemini/tmp/`)
  - Grok CLI: `~/.grok/` (sessions are read from `~/.grok/sessions/`)
  - Kimi: `~/.kimi/` or `~/.kimi-code/` (legacy sessions are read from `~/.kimi/sessions/`; Kimi Code sessions from `~/.kimi-code/sessions/`)
  - OpenCode: `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` with Node `node:sqlite` support or the `sqlite3` CLI available for read-only access.

Empty provider lists are normal on machines where no supported CLI has local session files yet.

## Runtime Architecture

`claudeville/server.js` binds to `HERMES_OFFICE_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) on `HERMES_OFFICE_PORT` (default `4000`), serves static files from `claudeville/`, exposes same-origin JSON API endpoints, upgrades WebSocket clients at `ws://localhost:4000/ws`, watches provider data paths, and broadcasts updates while clients are connected. Updates are debounced on filesystem events; a 2-second interval also runs unconditionally, with broadcasts becoming no-ops when no WebSocket clients are connected.

The frontend boot path is `claudeville/src/presentation/App.js`:

1. Domain: create `World` and add `BUILDING_DEFS` buildings.
2. Infrastructure: `ClaudeDataSource` and `WebSocketClient`.
3. Shared UI: `Toast`, `Modal`, `TopBar`, `Sidebar`.
4. Application services: `AgentManager`, `ModeManager`, `NotificationService`.
5. Load initial sessions and usage.
6. Start `SessionWatcher`.
7. Bind canvas `ResizeObserver`.
8. Dynamically load `IsometricRenderer` (World mode), then `DashboardRenderer`.
9. Create the right-side `ActivityPanel` and bind agent-follow.
10. Apply English UI strings.

The layout is a full-height flex shell: fixed-height top bar, left sidebar, central content area, and an optional 320px right activity panel. World mode fills the content area with a canvas. Dashboard mode scrolls vertically.

## Local Server API

The server defaults to port `4000` and the IPv4 loopback interface. `HERMES_OFFICE_HOST` and `HERMES_OFFICE_PORT` override the listener for containers. Requests with a non-local `Host` are rejected unless the exact lowercase `host:port` appears in comma-separated `HERMES_OFFICE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`; cross-origin browser `Origin` values are rejected, while origin-less CLI requests remain supported.

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/sessions` | Active sessions from all available providers. Accepts `force=1`, `force=true`, or `force=yes` to bypass the session-list cache. |
| `GET /api/session-detail?sessionId=&project=&provider=` | Tool history, recent messages, token usage where available. |
| `POST /api/session-details` | Batch detail fetch for visible or selected sessions. Body shape: `{ "items": [{ "key", "sessionId", "project", "provider" }] }`; request body max is 256 KiB, the server reads up to 100 items, skips invalid providers, and returns `count` as the number of returned detail payloads. |
| `GET /api/teams` | Claude Code team metadata from `~/.claude/teams/`. |
| `GET /api/tasks` | Claude Code task groups from `~/.claude/tasks/`. |
| `GET /api/providers` | Detected provider list and home directories. |
| `GET /api/usage` | Usage, subscription, activity, and quota metadata. |
| `GET /api/perf` | Lightweight runtime counters for manual performance checks. |
| `GET /api/changelog` | Raw `CHANGELOG.md` text; rendered by the in-app version-chip modal. |
| `ws://localhost:4000/ws` | Same-origin initial session payload, update broadcasts, and ping/pong. |

The server does not enable CORS or accept preflight requests. Missing or invalid routes receive JSON error responses.

## Provider Adapters

Adapters live in `claudeville/adapters/` and are registered in `adapters/index.js`. Each adapter reports whether its local provider directory exists, returns active sessions, returns detail for one session, and provides watch paths for live updates.

| Provider | Directory | Session source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` | `history.jsonl`, `projects/*/*.jsonl`, subagent files, teams, tasks | Supports main sessions, subagents, orphan/team-member sessions, token usage, teams, tasks, and git commit/push extraction. |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/` | Recent `rollout-*.jsonl` files under date folders | Reads recent rollouts, session metadata, tools, messages, token count events, reasoning effort, and git commit/push extraction. |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/` | `tmp/<project_hash>/chats/session-*.json` | Reads recent chat JSON files, attempts to reverse-map project hashes to local paths, and extracts git commit/push events where commands are present. |
| Grok CLI | `~/.grok/sessions/` | `<url-encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/{summary.json,updates.jsonl,chat_history.jsonl}` | Reads summary metadata (model, title, effort, activity), ACP update streams for tools/messages/context occupancy, chat history fallback, and git commit/push events from shell tools. Session ids are prefixed `grok-`. |
| Kimi | `~/.kimi/`, `~/.kimi-code/` | Legacy `sessions/<project_hash>/<session_uuid>/wire.jsonl`; Kimi Code `sessions/<workspace>/<session_uuid>/agents/<agent>/wire.jsonl` plus `session_index.jsonl` | Reads tool/message/status events, resolves projects from legacy hashes or the Kimi Code index, extracts token usage, surfaces Kimi Code child agents, and extracts git commit/push events. |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite session/message/part rows | Opens the database read-only via `node:sqlite` or `sqlite3 -readonly`, preserves OpenCode as the provider, exposes model families such as DeepSeek through `model`, and extracts git commit/push events from shell tools. |

Only active adapters are used. Claude-only concepts such as teams and tasks are optional and return empty arrays when unavailable.

`claudeville/adapters/index.js` owns aggregation and short-lived caches: session lists and detail payloads are cached for 5 seconds to protect the 2-second scheduler, detail payloads have an LRU-style trim, and adapter failures degrade to an empty or stale cached detail response instead of breaking the app.

## UI Modes

### World Mode

World mode is the current RPG visual direction. It renders an isometric pixel village on Canvas 2D with terrain, roads, a small pond, buildings, particles, a minimap, and agent sprites. Current buildings (source of truth: `claudeville/src/config/buildings.js`):

- Command Center: team status.
- Task Board: task status.
- Code Forge: code work.
- Token Mine: token usage.
- Grand Lore Archive: reading and search.
- Research Observatory: external research.
- Portal Gate: browser and remote tools.
- Pharos Lighthouse: GitHub and deploy sea watch.
- Harbor Master: commit ships and push departures.

Agents can be selected on the canvas. Selection opens the activity panel and makes the camera follow the selected sprite until the selection clears or the user drags the camera. Agents using `SendMessage` can move toward a matched recipient and show chat animation state.

Rendering is sprite-first. `IsometricRenderer.js` orchestrates the draw loop and data flow; `SceneryEngine.js`, `TerrainTileset.js`, `BuildingSprite.js`, `HarborTraffic.js`, `AgentSprite.js`, `SpriteRenderer.js`, `Compositor.js`, `SpriteSheet.js`, and `AssetManager.js` do the specialized work.

### Dashboard Mode

Dashboard mode renders DOM cards grouped by project. Cards show provider badge, model, role, status, current tool, recent message, and fetched tool history. Dashboard mode is designed for scanning active sessions without the RPG world.

`DashboardRenderer.js` fetches session details only while Dashboard mode is active, reuses project sections/cards across updates, and emits the same selection events as the sidebar/canvas. It shares `SessionDetailsService.js` with the activity panel so duplicate detail requests can be coalesced and briefly cached.

## Validation

Default non-runtime validation:

```bash
npm run validate:quick
```

Targeted syntax smoke:

```bash
npm run check:server
npm run check:adapters
npm run check:services
npm run check:frontend-syntax
npm run check:scripts
```

`scripts/smoke/` also has hand-run fixture checks for specific high-risk paths:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/adapters.mjs
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 node scripts/smoke/relationship.mjs
```

These smoke scripts are not part of `npm run validate:quick`.

Runtime smoke:

```bash
npm run dev
curl http://localhost:4000/api/providers
curl http://localhost:4000/api/sessions
```

For rendering changes, open `http://localhost:4000`, test both World and Dashboard modes, resize the browser, and verify the activity panel opens and closes when an agent can be selected.

Asset validation, when dev dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm run sprites:validate
npm run sprites:capture-fresh
npm run sprites:visual-diff
```

If dependencies are not installed and installing them is out of scope, fall back to manifest/code inspection plus `file claudeville/assets/sprites/**/*.png` checks for touched assets.

## Development Notes

- Keep provider session files read-only. ClaudeVille observes local CLI logs; it should not mutate them.
- Keep port `4000` unless all dependent docs and local workflows are updated together.
- `DEBUG_STATIC=1` logs static file requests; `DEBUG_WATCH=1` logs watch-path refresh details.
- Keep small changes within the current vanilla JavaScript and CSS architecture. There is no framework, bundler, transpiler, or app test runner today.
- Do not edit generated sprite PNGs without also checking `claudeville/assets/sprites/manifest.yaml` and the sprite validation rules.
- This repo is often edited by multiple agents. Check `git status --short` before changes and preserve unrelated local edits.
- See `docs/visual-experience-crafting.md` for the transferable design method behind the RPG world model.
