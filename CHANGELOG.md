# Hermes Office Changelog

---

## Unreleased

- Forked ClaudeVille as Hermes Office while retaining its MIT license, attribution, pixel village, dashboard, and existing provider adapters.
- Added a privacy-safe, read-only Hermes Agent adapter that discovers named profile session databases, normalizes sessions and parent relationships, aggregates token usage, and exposes sanitized tool names without prompts, reasoning, tool arguments, or tool results.
- Added deterministic SQLite fixture coverage for profile discovery, active-session filtering, parent mapping, malformed optional JSON, token aggregation, watch paths, and source-database integrity.
- Added stable profile-specific World and Dashboard characters for Jarvis, Light, and L using the existing Sol, Luna, and Terra sprite families without changing their reported model.
- Added conservative project inference from bounded Hermes gateway origin display metadata, with authoritative git/cwd precedence, parent inheritance, and no raw origin or title exposure.

## v0.33.3 — *The Returning Tide* · Aug 23, 2026

Commit fleets are visible in World mode again. The default WebGL renderer now carries Canvas-only harbor traffic onto the transparent world overlay instead of covering it with the opaque GPU scene.

**The fleet returns**
- **Unpushed commits are ships again.** Commit boats, packed fleets, repository flags, mooring marks, and harbor cargo labels render above the GPU-resident village while keeping their existing world positions and motion.
- **Push celebrations survive the compositor.** Harbor finale effects now use the same visible overlay whenever a GPU frame succeeds, so the journey from waiting commits to a shipped convoy remains complete.

**The renderer keeps its fast path**
- **Only the missing Canvas category is replayed.** Buildings, props, and agents stay on the GPU path; the overlay selectively draws harbor traffic without duplicating the rest of the village.
- **The fallback remains unchanged.** Canvas mode still uses its original depth-sorted pass, while focused tests cover selective GPU-overlay replay and the full 151-test quick validation remains green.

---

## v0.33.2 — *The Lettercarvers* · Aug 23, 2026

In-world text stays sharp on every display. The world canvas now picks its resolution from the physical pixel grid instead of a flat cap, so the browser can only ever scale the village by a whole number.

**Readable at any display scale**
- **The world renders at native device resolution.** The backing store was previously capped at CSS resolution, so on a Retina display every name plate, building plaque, and speech bubble was drawn at half resolution and stretched back up. Retina desktops now draw the village at full device resolution.
- **The canvas never lands between pixels again.** Large viewports used to fall to a fractional resolution and were then rescaled by a non-integer factor with nearest-neighbour filtering, which shredded the 1px strokes of the pixel fonts. Resolution is now always the device ratio divided by a whole number, so one canvas pixel covers an exact block of screen pixels; oversized viewports get chunkier, never smeared.
- **Browser zoom and mixed-DPI displays are handled.** Zoom tiers snap to whole backing pixels at fractional device ratios, and moving the window between a laptop panel and an external monitor now rebinds the canvas instead of leaving it scaled by the old ratio.

**Sharpness where it counts**
- **Annotations no longer thin out just because the display is sharp.** Agent render tiers and the fast sky, atmosphere, and prop paths measure the scene in layout pixels; a Retina canvas is no longer mistaken for a four-times-busier village.
- **Pixel budgets are spent deliberately.** One per-surface ceiling drives the whole ladder: laptop and 1440p-class viewports run native, 5K/6K viewports step down one whole rung, and the smooth sky caches stay at layout resolution because gradients gain nothing from four times the pixels.
- **Context loss no longer strands the water mask.** The PostFX mask is released with the other volatile surfaces and rebuilt on the next frame.

---

## v0.33.1 — *Quickened Glass* · Aug 21, 2026

World mode now reaches its fast steady state without trading away the Glasswrights renderer, while daylight lighting and animated water remain visually stable throughout GPU warm-up.

**A faster first watch**
- **GPU warm-up starts lean and restores the full scene quickly.** New contexts begin on the minimal effects rung, skip clear-weather work that cannot affect the frame, avoid unused daylight emission/bloom targets, and recover through the quality ladder once shader and texture uploads settle.
- **Local-light shading costs less after dusk.** The occlusion trace keeps its stepped pixel-shadow character with three samples instead of five, reducing the most expensive repeated texture work without flattening night lighting.

**Sunlight behaves like sunlight**
- **Point-light halos now answer to ambient darkness.** Broad daylight suppresses lighthouse, harbor, building, and lantern floodlight halos across direct GPU, flattened PostFX, and Canvas paths while authored glowing windows, runes, and fire pixels remain identifiable.

**One village, one composition path**
- **Adaptive recovery no longer flickers boats or water features.** Even at the lowest quality rung, the direct GPU scene remains resident while optional effects recover in place, so Canvas-only fauna and water layers cannot blink through between frames.
- **Release checks cover the regression.** Day/night browser captures, forced quality recovery, World/Dashboard switching, agent selection, 142 unit tests, sprite audits, and building/terrain validators all pass without console or frame errors.

---

## v0.33.0 — *The Glasswrights* · Aug 21, 2026

World mode becomes a semantic, GPU-resident pixel diorama: the village now knows which agents matter, which surfaces receive weather and light, and when visual detail should yield to operator clarity.

**A world with material memory**
- **WebGL2 now renders the village directly.** Terrain, landmarks, props, and animated agent frames stay in GPU-managed textures instead of uploading one flattened Canvas frame every render. The complete Canvas path remains available with `?renderer=canvas`, and `?postfx=0` still provides the allocation-free escape hatch.
- **Nine landmarks gained authored material contracts.** Stone, timber, metal, water, foliage, fabric, cobble, glass/runes, and fire respond differently to phase light, rain, fog, reflections, local occlusion, and quantized sun bands. Emissive windows, runes, forge fire, lanterns, and the lighthouse now bloom from named masks—and stay restrained in broad daylight.
- **Deterministic atlas tooling ships with the renderer.** A reviewed 18-asset, 209-frame pilot includes byte-stable albedo/material/emissive/occluder atlases, manifest validation, channel contact sheets, mask-fix tooling, and safe defaults for assets without companions.

**The crowd speaks more clearly**
- **One salience governor now owns the scene.** Needs-you, error, selection, recent events, working detail, and ambience share collision and occupancy budgets. Primary cues never disappear; routine particles, plaques, labels, and tool text quiet down before the village art does.
- **Names and thoughts have a stable grammar.** Agent identity stays below the feet, thoughts and current actions stay above the head, and both participate in one collision plane. GPU animation uses complete source silhouettes so movement no longer drops body or equipment pixels.
- **Claude and Codex share five readable action poses.** Read, work, think, talk, and celebrate add small modular pixel gestures without changing simulation cadence, and reduced motion keeps a complete static version of every cue.

**Triage before transcript**
- **Dashboard cards default to compact dossiers.** A cross-project queue orders Needs You, errors/rate limits, high burn, working sessions, and quiet agents; full tool/message history expands only for the selected card.
- **Inspection preserves orientation.** World selection saves the overview pose, composes against the detail panel, and restores the camera unless the operator moved it manually. A compact controls popover documents navigation and replay commands.

**Built to degrade cleanly**
- **Historical routes no longer web over the village.** Hour-long movement history stays recorded for diagnostics but is not painted across the overview; only a short, restrained recent route survives for the selected or action-needed agent.
- **Renderer budgets now name every owner.** Upload, shader, frame-gap, texture, attachment, buffer, Canvas, atlas, and trail diagnostics feed a hysteretic quality ladder. Context loss, Dashboard suspension, visibility changes, and resume release and rebuild resources without stale-context warnings.
- **Release evidence is reproducible.** Deterministic World scenarios, hardware metadata, overlay censuses, performance scripts, and 20 approved day/night visual baselines cover the new pipeline. The final suite passes 141 unit tests plus building, terrain, sprite, material-channel, and visual-diff gates.

---

## v0.32.0.1 · Aug 21, 2026 — Hotfix

GPU light glows no longer render as bright daylight discs (seen over the market stall and torches around Command), and the baked lantern posts got their night halos back.

- **The disc was a falloff bug, not a gating one.** The glow shader's hard 0.35-radius core drew a solid ball where the Canvas-2D pass draws a cached radial gradient (0.5 alpha core mixed toward white, 0.25 at a third of the radius, fading to the rim). The shader now reproduces that exact gradient, at the 2D pass's `0.14 × lightBoost²` strength envelope.
- **Day visibility preserved where the 2D path has it.** The ambient stamp pass is *not* night-gated in 2D — transient semantic lights (arrivals, rituals, relationship cues) and faint building glows keep their daylight presence instead of being suppressed wholesale.
- **Lantern posts glow at night again.** The baked lantern/brazier prop halos come from a separate, night-gated 2D pass (`_drawLanternGlows`) whose sources were never in the light feed — the GPU path had dropped them. They are now fed as flagged lights carrying the lantern night factor (`0.42 × nightFactor`, dusk-onward only).

---

## v0.32.0 — *Lanternfire* · Aug 21, 2026

World mode gains a hybrid GPU pipeline: the Canvas-2D village stays the source of truth while a new WebGL2 post-processing stage grades, glows, and blooms the finished frame — and steps aside automatically the moment it cannot earn its keep.

**The village learns to glow**
- **Night belongs to the lanterns.** Building windows, watchfires, braziers, the forge, and the lighthouse beacon now bloom into nearby roads and harbor water through a GPU bright-pass and Kawase blur, driven by the same light registry the 2D renderer already keeps.
- **The atmosphere grade moved to the GPU.** When the post stage is active it owns the day/night grade and edge vignette from the same atmosphere inputs; the classic 2D multiply grade remains byte-for-byte intact as the fallback path.
- **Water bends the light.** Harbor and shoreline tiles get flow-aware displacement and a faint reflection hint, masked by a quarter-resolution water mask that rebuilds only when the camera moves.
- **Weather, rays, and pulses.** Dawn/dusk god rays, forge heat haze, incident chromatic pulses, and a low-amplitude film grain round out the pass — every animated term honors the motion budget and freezes under reduced motion.

**Text never gets graded**
- **A third canvas carries the UI.** Labels, bubbles, primary marks, weather foreground, screen particles, cinematic letterbox, and the debug overlay now draw on a dedicated overlay canvas above the GL output, so post-processing can never distort a letter.

**It degrades before it drops frames**
- **A hysteretic effects ladder.** Sustained over-budget frames shed god rays and reflections first, then collapse to grade-plus-glows, then hand the whole frame back to Canvas-2D — the scene itself is never half-rated or half-resolved. Healthy frames probe back up slowly.
- **Stalls cannot hide.** The ladder watches instrumented upload/CPU/GPU timings *and* the raw gap between frames, so driver-side stalls that dodge the timers still trigger fallback.
- **Escape hatches.** `?postfx=0` skips the GPU path (and its allocations) entirely; Shift-D shows live post-FX level, timings, and texture bytes; WebGL2 absence or context loss falls back instantly with no visual regression from v0.31.

---

## v0.31.0.1 · Aug 20, 2026 — Hotfix

World mode now renders through an opaque canvas, sparing the desktop compositor per-frame alpha blending of the whole village layer.

- **The canvas declares itself opaque.** The sky pass already repaints the full viewport every frame, so the World canvas backing store is created with `alpha: false`; the browser compositor can skip blending the layer against the page. Measured on a busy 240 Hz desktop, worst-case frame pacing tightened from 21 ms to 16.8 ms with no visual change.

---

## v0.31.0 — *The Taskboard* · Aug 12, 2026

ClaudeVille now follows Oh My Pi orchestration as a first-class provider, keeping the parent session, nested agents, lineage, conversation, tool activity, and usage visible in the same village watch.

**The whole party stays in view**
- **OMP has a proper adapter.** ClaudeVille reads OMP's local session transcripts without modifying them and discovers both orchestration parents and nested agent runs.
- **Lineage survives the handoff.** Parent-child links, agent names, model identities, and underlying providers remain attached as nested work moves through the village.
- **Details carry the work.** Session detail views now include OMP messages, tool history, response usage, and token totals instead of reducing an orchestrated run to a single process row.

**A new house on the map**
- **The taskboard welcomes OMP.** Provider labels, badges, hues, arrival cues, agent prefixes, and home-building placement all recognize OMP sessions consistently.
- **The watch stays local and read-only.** OMP data comes from `~/.omp/agent/sessions/`; the server watches transcript changes and never writes to provider state.

**Pressure you can verify**
- **The release gate is green.** Dedicated OMP adapter coverage passes alongside the full 101-test dependency-free unit suite, syntax checks, live API detail checks, and a browser dashboard smoke test.

---

## v0.30.0 — *The Quartermaster* · Jul 28, 2026

ClaudeVille now keeps substantially more headroom during long watches. Session readers reuse bounded work, World releases its heavyweight resources while Dashboard is active, and the keep's controls communicate their state in one compact glance.

**The village carries less**
- **Dashboard truly puts World to sleep.** Switching modes releases the World canvas, decoded sprites, hit masks, outlines, composited agent sheets, and volatile caches, then restores them before animation resumes.
- **Trails remember the journey, not every footfall.** Paths now follow visible sprite movement, suppress stationary duplicates, compact older samples, and enforce bounded hydration and rendering.

**Session watching stays warm**
- **Provider readers reuse bounded work.** Claude transcript tails are projected once, while Gemini, Grok, Kimi, and OpenCode use capped caches and active-first or resumable discovery paths instead of repeatedly sweeping full histories.
- **Git stays quiet until something changes.** Ref-aware signatures, longer-lived caches, scoped invalidation, and coalesced watcher events make unchanged warm refreshes zero-command while retaining nested-ref detection.

**Long-running state has firm edges**
- **History cannot grow without limit.** Chronicle reads are paginated, agent signatures stay compact, biography and affinity memories are capped, and superseded WebSocket snapshots are released promptly.
- **Background work respects ownership.** Desktop notifications close cleanly, delayed modal reads cannot replace newer content, and hidden activity panels stop unnecessary timer work.

**Four controls, one glance**
- **Log → Alerts → Sound → Cinema.** The topbar's text controls are now a scroll, town bell, minstrel notes, and scrying eye. Inactive toggles recede into warm gray; active controls catch the keep's torchlight.

**Pressure you can verify**
- **Runtime health is measurable.** Diagnostics now report watcher, parsing, Git, trail, canvas, and asset pressure, backed by stricter watcher checks and warm-up-aware soak gates.
- **The regression floor is broader.** Oversized transcripts, deep provider indexes, nested Git refs, bounded trails, mode suspension, lifecycle ownership, and quota body limits all have focused coverage.

The release gate covers 100 dependency-free unit tests, 250 World–Dashboard transitions, bounded oversized-transcript and trail fixtures, zero-command unchanged Git refreshes, and a fresh-code 10-minute browser/30-minute server soak with no frame failures, no retained Dashboard World surfaces, browser heap inside its growth gate, and negative server-RSS slopes.

---

## v0.29.0.2 · Jul 27, 2026 — Hotfix

Agents now stay on the landmark bridge's center deck and complete crowded crossings without being redirected or pushed backward.

- **The crossing matches the art.** Only the authored center deck is walkable; decorative side spans, rails, lanterns, and water remain outside the traversal grid.
- **Completed agents keep their destination.** Ambient routes are no longer discarded and rebuilt every frame when a completed or idle status has no new destination.
- **Opposing traffic keeps moving.** Bridge lanes follow the crossing's authored direction, ignore non-walkable spans, and preserve forward progress while agents separate.

---

## v0.29.0.1 · Jul 27, 2026 — Hotfix

Agents now keep making forward progress through crowded roads and building approaches instead of turning back and forth around the same few pixels.

- **Crowd steering cannot undo a step.** Lane discipline and collision separation retain their useful sideways motion, but corrections that would push an agent farther from its current waypoint are constrained so slowed or congested villagers cannot be held in place indefinitely.
- **The failure stays fixed.** Focused regression coverage reproduces a slow walker facing a stronger reverse correction and proves it still reaches the waypoint.

---

## v0.29.0 — *The Wardens* · Jul 26, 2026

ClaudeVille now guards its private local data, keeps session history truthful across failures and reloads, and stays bounded through long-running work and heavy weather.

**The gate is local again**
- **Private data stays on the machine.** The server now binds explicitly to IPv4 loopback, rejects non-local hosts and cross-origin browser requests, and exposes WebSockets only on the validated same-origin `/ws` path. Malformed, unmasked, fragmented, or oversized frames are closed cleanly instead of being accepted by the hand-written protocol layer.

**The village does not rewrite its own history**
- **Transient failures no longer empty the town.** A failed provider poll is distinct from a successful empty result, so brief read or network failures preserve the current village. Agent details, usage panels, and Dashboard footers clear at identity boundaries instead of showing another agent's stale data.
- **Reloads are idempotent.** Biography pushes, meetings, messages, shared Git events, moods, Chronicle entries, and spend totals now retain compact bounded identities or watermarks. Reloading the same evidence cannot inflate milestones, relationships, streaks, or the day book, and shutdown waits for pending Chronicle and spend writes before closing storage.

**Every authored route leads somewhere**
- **World visits use real capacity.** All 83 base and overflow visit slots are unique, walkable, and reachable from the gate. Blocked targets can fall back only to an adjacent tile, so agents no longer report success while stopping several tiles away.

**Less repeated work**
- **Live transcripts stay warm.** Claude and Codex reuse parsed JSONL tails and parse safe appends incrementally. Claude's historical subagent scan now rechecks active children without restatting thousands of cold transcripts every broadcast, cutting measured warm collection from roughly 95–154 ms to 25–38 ms on the release workstation.
- **Rain keeps its character without taking the frame.** Rain, water, fog, puddle, and reflection work is bounded and profiled only when requested. Paired release runs kept heavy rain within 28.6% of clear weather at 25 agents and 21.4% at 50, with zero frame failures.

**Controls that work the way they look**
- **Keyboard and screen-reader paths are complete.** Sidebar agents, parent links, Dashboard selection, modal focus, and toast announcements now use native non-nested controls and explicit state. Gemini and appearance/team changes also resolve to the same avatar identity in World and Dashboard.

The release gate passed 73 dependency-free unit tests, a 250-switch browser lifecycle run, security and API probes, all sprite and World validators, a zero-vulnerability dependency audit, and a 60-second live soak with stable listener, watcher, canvas, cache, heap, and RSS bounds.

---

## v0.28.1 — *Chisel & Grain* · Jul 25, 2026

A pass over the places where the pixel village was quietly drawing itself in vectors — smooth curves, resampled lettering, and authored art that never reached the screen.

**The gate says its own name again**
- **CLAUDEVILLE is legible.** The town's name was baked into the gate sprite at a five-pixel cap height and then sheared onto the isometric axis along with the masonry, which reduced it to "ELAUDEVIL.E". Stone survives being resampled; letterforms do not. The band is now empty in the art and the name is drawn live into it, sheared to sit in the band while every glyph stem stays on a whole pixel column. Sharp at every zoom, day and night.

**Water is one body again**
- **The checkerboard is actually gone.** Depth shading covered only the lower half of each tile with a hard seam across the middle, which tiles into precisely the light/dark checkerboard the last overhaul removed from the depth *classification*. Shading now covers the whole tile and follows the shore distance already computed for each body of water, so lagoon, river and sea grade from rim to centre as coherent masses.

**Art that was already made now shows up**
- **Monuments are the sprites they were drawn as.** Every one of the village's monuments was rendering as stacked antialiased ellipses — smooth grey discs in a world of hard pixel steps — because the asset manager was never handed to the monument layer. The four authored cairn, stele, obelisk and founding-stone sprites now draw, and major monuments get their quiet mote trickle.

**The wall stops looking sketched**
- **Ivy and shrubs are pixels, not strokes.** The trailing ivy was a soft two-pixel polyline and the shrubs were ellipses; both read as marker scribbles against hard-edged planks. They are now stepped forms with a direction of light.
- **Torches burn in steps.** Flames were two sharp vector triangles; they now taper in stacked rows around a lit core.
- **The footing meets the ground.** Where the stone footing tumbles out it drew four flat grey squares outlined on all four sides, with no shading and no contact — UI boxes sitting on the sand. They now carry the same lit-edge and shadow treatment as the course above, with contact shadows and a slight stagger.

**One hand drawing the whole village**
- **Shared pixel primitives.** Flames were implemented four separate times — gate brazier, wall torch, command watchfire, watchtower beacon — each as filled triangles or quadratic curves that read as paper cutouts. They now share one stepped-row flame with a lit core, and the beacon brazier is a pixel bowl rather than an outlined vector ellipse.
- **Water tiles meet exactly.** The depth tint is rasterised with the exactly-tiling isometric scanline decomposition instead of a path fill, so translucent per-tile shading leaves neither a hairline between tiles nor a doubled dark lattice where they overlap.

**Ground that does not repeat**
- **Interior terrain varies.** The tileset holds one source cell per edge pattern, so every fully-interior tile drew the identical image and a field of dirt or grass read as a stamped repeat at tile frequency. Interior tiles now mirror horizontally on a per-tile hash — free variety, no new art, and the light direction is preserved.

**A coastline with courses**
- **The island edge is layered.** The sand lip and the cliff face below it were smooth vertical gradients, the one thing a pixel coastline cannot be. Both are now quantised into discrete courses, same silhouette and colours, in the same idiom as the rock above them.
- **The reef falls away.** Where a basin drops from shallow to deep the base art changes at a tile boundary, so the edge read as a hard staircase however smoothly the depth graded over it. Deep water bordering shallows now carries an inset darker rim, so the step reads as a shelf.

**Two artefacts, found by bisecting the render passes**
- **No more ruled lines across open water.** Long, perfectly straight pale streaks crossed the open sea. The shoreline foam mask counted neighbours *outside* the map as land, so every water tile along the edge of the tile array grew a coastline — foam drawn along a boundary that is an artefact of the array, not a feature of the world. Twenty-nine percent of all foam was spurious; the genuine coastlines keep theirs.
- **The sun stays in the sky.** The sun is drawn twice: once into the backdrop behind the world, and again in the canopy pass that deliberately composites over the village so aurora and shooting stars are not hidden behind it. That is right for the sun's glow and rays, which are additive and read as glare — and wrong for its body, which is opaque and was being stamped onto whatever lay beneath it, most obviously as a disc sitting on the ocean at close zoom. The canopy now carries only the glare; the backdrop still draws the full stepped disc, so the sun is crisp wherever sky is actually visible.

All of the added detail bakes once into the existing prop and terrain caches rather than running per frame; monuments got cheaper, not dearer, by moving from vector paths to sprite blits. Measured on the deterministic world benchmark: 48 FPS median at 10 agents and 40 at 25, at or above the v0.27 reference of 46 and 40, with zero frame failures.

## v0.28.0 — *Bell & Ledger* · Jul 25, 2026

The village can finally tell the difference between an agent that is thinking, one that is blocked on you, and one that has finished. It stops evicting the agents that need you, rings a bell you can hear from another window, keeps a day book of everything that happened, and tells you the truth about what you are spending.

**The town knows what your agents are actually doing**
- **Turn state read from the transcript.** Status came from a stopwatch on file modification time plus two hard-coded tool names, so "thinking", "blocked on you", and "finished" all looked the same after thirty seconds of quiet. ClaudeVille now reads the real signal: a closed turn means the next move is yours, and an unanswered tool call means a tool is pending.
- **Permission prompts are recognised.** A pending tool is judged blocked or merely slow from the session's permission mode, the tool's class, and how long it has been sitting — fifteen seconds for tools that are normally instant, four minutes for Bash and friends, immediately for a direct question. A long build is no longer mistaken for something that needs you.
- **Completed is a real status.** The soft-gold "completed" state has existed everywhere since v0.26 and nothing had ever produced it. Finished turns now light it up, in the world and on the dashboard.
- **Blocked agents say what they are blocked on.** "Waiting for approval — Bash" instead of a generic "Waiting for you", in both the dashboard card and the activity panel.

**Nobody vanishes while you are away**
- **Sessions that stop to ask stay in the village.** A session used to leave two minutes after its file went quiet — which is exactly when it finished a turn or stopped on a permission prompt. Those two states now stay resident for up to 45 minutes, capped, and are re-judged as their wait lengthens. Sessions that vanish mid-work still leave, as before.
- **Watching costs no more than it did.** Discovery, project tracking, and the file watchers all still run on the original two-minute window; only what reaches the browser holds residents.

**A bell you can hear from another window**
- **The tab tells you.** A count in the title and a marked favicon, so the village can reach you from a background tab on the other monitor.
- **A summons cue.** Needing a person finally has its own sound — a rising two-note call, distinct from the storm and distress cues, rate-limited like every other cue.
- **Alerts that lead somewhere.** The ATTN chip is now a button and `A` cycles waiting agents; both select and follow, so noticing and looking are one step. An optional ALERTS toggle adds desktop notifications, asked for by you and only fired while the tab is hidden.

**The Village Chronicle**
- **A day book you can read.** Arrivals and departures, waits and how long they lasted, finished turns, errors, rate limits, commits and pushes, all recorded to a readable ledger and timeline. Look away for forty minutes and the town can now tell you what you missed.
- **Told in the town's voice.** Commit subjects are dug out of the shell text agents actually ran and capped to one readable line; the two records git enrichment produces for a single commit collapse into one; repository watchers no longer "arrive"; and reloading the tab no longer re-announces the whole town. The recap opens from the LOG button in the topbar.

**Numbers that mean something**
- **Today, not lifetime.** The topbar's biggest number was the summed lifetime cost of whatever sessions were on screen; it lurched whenever one appeared or aged out. It is now the tokens observed today, banked from real growth and persisted across reloads.
- **Cache reads counted separately.** They are the same prompt re-read every turn and they dominated the total — the first cut of the burn rate read 486M tokens per hour. New tokens carry the headline; cache reads are priced into the day's accounting where they belong.
- **Quota headroom at a glance.** Two small gauges on the brand line show the 5-hour and 7-day windows and turn red near the ceiling. On a subscription that is the resource that actually runs out, so the dollar figure moved into the Chronicle and is labelled for what it is.
- **Alerts can no longer be crowded out.** When the topbar runs short of room the spend ledger yields first; the errored and attention badges always survive.

**Under the hood**
- **A test floor for the signal layer.** 44 `node:test` cases now cover turn-state derivation, pending-tool classification, status priority, residency, the day book, and the spend ledger — no dependency, no build step, wired into `npm run validate:quick`. They caught two real bugs while being written.

---

## v0.27.0 — *Fleetfoot Keep* · Jul 23, 2026

ClaudeVille now stays markedly smoother through crowded workdays and heavy rain without thinning the village, disabling weather, or lowering sprite quality. Repeated canvas work is reused where its pixels are identical, semantic crowd updates move off the per-frame path, and a deterministic benchmark makes World performance reproducible instead of anecdotal.

**Storms spend less paint**
- **Weather washes are reused.** The vertically varying overcast and fog grades render once into a one-pixel strip and stretch across the viewport, while live rain streaks, splashes, ripples, lightning, and moving fog keep their full animation.
- **Trails fit their actual footprint.** Persisted paths cache only the cropped area containing visible trail points instead of allocating a full transparent viewport canvas, with pixel-identical output.
- **Static atmosphere work stays static.** Immutable atmosphere asset descriptors and quieter frame bookkeeping remove repeated allocations without changing draw order or scene composition.

**Crowds share the work**
- **Equipment is rasterized once.** A bounded, scale-aware cache reuses pixel-identical Codex equipment layers across crowded scenes while arrival, archive, hand, and procedural weapon animation remains live.
- **One crowd snapshot serves the frame.** Building occupancy, visit allocation, relationship reconciliation, and team plaza preferences reuse shared agent state on their existing semantic cadence instead of rebuilding it for every landmark or frame.
- **Unchanged rosters stay quiet.** Identical two-second session snapshots refresh in-memory activity age without broadcasting full agent updates; minute-level age changes still reach the Dashboard and sidebar.

**Performance you can reproduce**
- **Deterministic World scenarios.** New 1, 10, 25, and 50-agent fixtures pin the camera, date, weather, render mode, and device scale for comparable clear and heavy-rain runs.
- **FPS and frame costs are recorded together.** The benchmark reports app FPS, raw animation-frame percentiles, slow frames, frame failures, host load, and optional update/render segment profiles while counterbalancing run order.
- **Stable-load release reference.** On the release workstation at 1600×1000 and DPR 1, median clear-weather FPS measured 60, 46, 40, and 33 for 1, 10, 25, and 50 working agents; heavy rain measured 29, 27, 24, and 22, with zero frame failures across all 24 runs.

---

## v0.26.2 · Jul 22, 2026 — Hotfix

ClaudeVille's pixel art now stays clean at every resting World zoom, including when the browser is displayed below 100%. Common 1080p layouts also render at native canvas resolution instead of passing through avoidable fractional resampling.

**Crisp at every resting zoom**
- **Display-pixel-aligned camera tiers.** World zoom levels adapt to sub-100% browser scaling so each authored sprite pixel occupies exactly one, two, or three physical pixels after the camera settles.
- **Every camera path agrees.** Wheel and keyboard zoom, agent follow, cinematic framing, resize recovery, auto-framing, and scripted capture poses all resolve through the same aligned zoom tiers.
- **Live browser scaling stays stable.** Changing browser zoom remaps current and in-flight camera poses without losing the chosen tier or leaving the World at a fractional resting scale.

**More native-resolution coverage**
- **1080p stays native.** The visible-canvas budget rises from 1.5 to 2 million pixels, covering common full-HD World layouts without downsampling.
- **Large canvases remain guarded.** Higher resolutions still scale progressively within the aggregate renderer budget, preserving the existing memory and frame-rate protections.

---

## v0.26.1 — *Firm Foundations* · Jul 18, 2026

ClaudeVille's landmarks now belong to the terrain beneath them. Every World building has an explicit grounding contract, so foundations, thresholds, shadows, and waterfront supports follow the site instead of reading as raised sprite slabs.

**Every building meets the ground**
- **Nine authored grounding profiles.** The Command Center, Portal, Archive, Task Board, Forge, Mine, Observatory, Watchtower, and Harbor now declare their terrain relationship, contact span, shadow shape, and entrance threshold explicitly.
- **Foundations belong to the world.** Terrain aprons and threshold paths are baked into the terrain cache, while the Archive's dais, Harbor quay, and Watchtower pilings keep their intentional elevation without making the whole sprite float.
- **Raised lawns and false platforms removed.** Structure masks and targeted site-color cutouts strip baked-in grass, stone, and dirt slabs from the affected sprites while preserving their pixel architecture.

**Contact that holds up in motion**
- **Structure-aware shadows.** Deterministic stepped contact shadows follow each building's actual footprint instead of using a generic resting ellipse.
- **Diagnostics for every landmark.** Shift+D grounding overlays expose profile mode, footprint, contact line, shadow polygon, threshold path, and validation state directly in the World view.
- **Full visual coverage.** Day and night baselines now center every building type, with manifest and world validators enforcing explicit dimensions, anchors, grounding modes, contact spans, and migration masks.

## v0.26.0 — *Painter's Guild* · Jul 17, 2026

The guild has repainted the whole town. The sea reads as one deep body of water instead of a checkerboard, the ground is hand-textured painterly turf and cobble, sky rewards burst over the village instead of hiding behind it, and every villager, building, card, and panel now speaks one color language. This is the largest visual overhaul since the founding — and it costs the town nothing: the desktop widgets were retired and every effect ships within the v0.25 performance budget.

**Water & ground, remade**
- **The checkerboard is gone.** Water depth is classified by distance-to-land, so lagoon, river, and sea read as coherent shallow-rim-to-deep-center masses with lerped tones, wet-sand shorelines, a one-mass sea gradient, and baked iso wavelets.
- **Painterly terrain suite.** All six Wang tilesets were rebaked as textured art: wildflower meadow, earthen paths, grey-blue cobbles, golden shore sand, teal shallows over sandy beds, cobalt deep water, flagstone plaza — generated through a new manifest-driven REST tileset pipeline.
- **The land coheres.** A low-frequency noise field turns per-tile confetti into authored masses; roads grow worn verges; a plank bridge now crosses the river mid-map; props cast contact shadows; building bases no longer seam against the terrain.

**Sky & light**
- **Rewards you can actually see.** Aurora, shooting stars, and sky-flares moved to the canopy pass over the village, with a warm whole-village pulse on a successful push; nights gain viewport-scaled stars and ambient meteors; the sun is a crisp stepped pixel disc; day length follows the season; fleet-driven storms take a subtle violet cast so the weather honestly says when the fleet is struggling.
- **Night keeps its promises.** Waiting beacons, selection rings, and incident pills are re-stamped after the atmosphere multiply, so the marks that must never be lost stay readable in the dark; ground fog drifts over the water at dawn.

**A crowd of individuals**
- **No more clone armies.** Per-sheet palette sources make per-agent variants and team sashes actually render, and every agent's animation phase is seeded from its id, so a crowd no longer breathes as one organism.
- **Legible at a glance.** Stronger selection rings, hover rings with name pills, contrast-fixed name tags, identical cluster bubbles that merge into one with a ×N chip, and provider-colored zoom-out impostors.

**One town, two windows**
- **One status language.** A single canonical status ramp feeds both canvas and DOM through a boot-time token bridge — guarded by a new smoke check so it can never drift again — and `completed` is finally a first-class, softly golden status everywhere. Rate-limited moves to steel blue, and provider hues no longer collide with status hues.
- **The dashboard earns its keep.** Attention-state header washes, collapsed empty tool history, FLIP-animated reorders, relative timestamps, a calmer chip row, district-tinted portraits, ambience that follows the world clock, and a warm hearth glow under the grid. Modal and toasts join the parchment-and-bronze fold with proper dialog semantics.
- **Landmarks with presence.** Chronicle monuments are real sprites (cairn, stele, obelisk, founding stones) with a quiet mote over major ones; occupied buildings grow lit windows, occupancy pennants, and a dais ring; the observatory opens its dome aperture at night; an empty village gets a slow dusk tour.

**Craft under the hood**
- **44+ PixelLab asset bakes.** Broken cube layers rebaked as isolated objects, placeholder props and vegetation replaced, effort rings made distinguishable, and a validator upgrade (dimension + cube-fill heuristics) that would have caught every shipped defect.
- **Budget respected.** Rain-veil and gradient-allocation hot paths removed; every new motion ships its reduced-motion static fallback; camera event cues honor reduced motion.
- **Sharp at your size.** Canvas backing snaps to pixel-uniform ratios only when nearly free — 1080p and up keep full sharpness instead of a 2× nearest upscale.

**Farewell, widgets.** The macOS menu-bar app and KDE Plasma widget are retired, along with their build scripts, routes, and checks — one surface, done well.

---

## v0.25.2 — *Town Crier* · Jul 17, 2026

Kimi villagers now speak plainly about the tools they wield, and the town's records of where Kimi Code sessions live are hardened against the current session-store layout.

**Clearer Kimi captions**
- **Questions are heard.** AskUserQuestion turns now surface the actual question in villager captions and the Activity Panel instead of a blank tool input.
- **More tools named outright.** Task, skill, and cron-style calls now show their identifiers (`task_id`, `skill`, `id`) in captions and tool history rather than falling silent.

**Hardened Kimi Code session mapping**
- **The right home address.** When the session index lacks an entry, project resolution now prefers `state.json`'s top-level `workDir` over the agent `homedir`, which on current Kimi Code builds points inside the session store rather than at the project.
- **Fixtures stand watch.** Adapter fixtures now pin the `workDir`-over-`homedir` precedence, question captions, and the new tool-input fields, so future Kimi Code format drift fails loudly instead of emptying the village.

---

## v0.25.1 — *Open Waters* · Jul 14, 2026

Pushed commit ships now complete their voyage cleanly, fading into open water instead of turning back toward the island after reaching the sea.

**Clean departures**
- **No return leg after open water.** Successful push routes now end at the established sea-lane endpoint, removing the randomized final leg that could point ships back across the island.
- **Fade on arrival.** Each ship's opacity and mist timing follow its actual departure duration, reaching zero as the ship arrives at open water rather than several seconds afterward.
- **Regression coverage.** The deterministic Harbor scenario now verifies both the final route endpoint and zero opacity on arrival.

---

## v0.25.0 — *Steady Hearth* · Jul 14, 2026

ClaudeVille can now stay open through long coding sessions without its history, watchers, canvases, or village state growing without bound. The town keeps its existing look, motion, density, and two-second freshness contract while doing substantially less repeated work.

**A lighter, steadier runtime**
- **Watch only what is alive.** Historical provider trees no longer expand into tens of thousands of kernel watches; bounded discovery, active-file watches, stat probes, reconciliation, and deterministic shutdown keep the live footprint near 60 watches on the same corpus that previously required 44,669.
- **Session history stays bounded.** Claude transcript aggregation is incremental, byte-budgeted, cancellable, and cooperative for large first scans; shared tails, usage history, Codex discovery, and provider indexes now retain compact bounded state.
- **Refresh the part that changed.** Provider and Git invalidation is scoped to the affected session or project, with separate caches and immediate recovery after transient Git failures instead of repeated global rescans.

**A village built for long visits**
- **World state has firm horizons.** Fade colors, paths, cooldowns, tool events, Harbor replay state, visit intents, biographies, affinities, nicknames, landmarks, and chronicle work now expire or evict without changing what is visible on screen.
- **Clean starts and clean exits.** App boot, teardown, sockets, polling, details requests, audio visibility, renderer failures, WebGL context loss, canvases, listeners, and IndexedDB-backed work now have explicit ownership and bounded recovery paths.
- **The same town, less frame work.** Invariant water descriptors, unchanged-state Harbor and visit reconciliation, targeted building masks/outlines, finite sprite variants, and Dashboard geometry reuse reduce CPU and retained pixels without lowering scene quality or animation cadence.

**Desktop companions and diagnostics**
- **Stable widgets.** The macOS widget reuses its WebViews and single-flights refreshes; KDE guards superseded XHR batches. Both bundles use the self-hosted Press Start 2P font and its license.
- **Release gates for the long run.** Bounded `/api/perf` diagnostics and focused watcher, transcript, cache, lifecycle, World, widget, and soak smokes make memory and stability regressions reproducible.

---

## v0.24.2.1 · Jul 13, 2026 — Hotfix

Codex villagers spawned from large forked histories now retain their exact GPT-5.6 identity instead of falling back to the generic Codex model.

- **Correct model identity.** Delayed `turn_context` metadata is recovered with a bounded backward scan, restoring Sol, Terra, and Luna labels, reasoning effort, pricing, colors, and character sprites.
- **Regression coverage.** Adapter fixtures now cover both directly recorded GPT-5.6 variants and child variants inferred when Codex persists the parent's model.

---

## v0.24.2 — *Lamplighter's Watch* · Jul 12, 2026

Night stays dark enough for stars, fireflies, and torchlight to matter, but the village no longer disappears into the grade. Moonlight now preserves more terrain detail, while the lanterns already placed around the village cast broader pools of warm light across roads, bridges, work yards, and quiet research paths.

**Brighter nights, warmer roads**
- **A clearer moonlight floor.** The night grade lifts shadow detail and eases the darkest vignette edges without flattening the cool sky, deep water, or strong building silhouettes.
- **Lanterns light their surroundings.** Existing lantern and brazier props now act as true ambient point lights, spreading warm ground illumination around the bridge, gate approach, workshop, mine road, and village paths.
- **Focused flames, restrained glow.** Compact flickering halos remain at each flame while the wider light pools stay soft, keeping agents, labels, and status effects at the top of the visual hierarchy.

---

## v0.24.1 — *Stoneward* · Jul 12, 2026

ClaudeVille's waterfront boundary has grown into a proper fortified entrance. The old flat palisade and loosely assembled gate are replaced by darker timberwork, continuous masonry, asset-backed watchtowers, and a civic arch that carries the village name as part of the structure.

**A gate worthy of the village**
- **Asset-backed gatehouse.** New hand-finished PixelLab sprites provide matching stone-and-timber watchtowers and a dedicated central arch, with `CLAUDEVILLE` baked into the masonry instead of painted as runtime canvas text.
- **One coherent structure.** The arch, animated door leaves, and tower jambs now layer in architectural order; the connector follows the world's isometric axis and remains aligned in both open and closed states.
- **Stronger doors and warmer arrival.** Braced timber leaves replace the flat slabs, while paired gate braziers provide balanced light without a hanging lantern obscuring the entrance.

**The fortified boundary**
- **Continuous stone footing.** The waterfront wall now sits on cool-grey mortared masonry that matches the gate towers and nearby village buildings.
- **Purposeful timberwork.** Dark walnut panels, cross braces, calmer stake spacing, stone buttresses, restrained slate caps, ivy, and torch details give the palisade depth without competing with the village interior.

**Every villager stays grounded**
- **Accessory cells are isolated.** Hats and equipment are clipped to their owning animation cell during composition, preventing tall accessories from leaking into adjacent frames and being mistaken for another frame's feet.
- **Provider-wide protection.** The grounding correction applies to every agent model and accessory combination, including the GPT-5.6 villagers that first exposed the levitation bug.

---

## v0.24.0 — *Bells & Birdsong* · Jul 12, 2026

The village finds its voice. The old sound toggle played a fixed synth drone that ignored everything on screen; it is replaced by a reactive soundscape that scores what the village is actually doing — and a proper tune. Still fully procedural Web Audio: no samples, no assets, no build step. Sound stays opt-in and off by default.

**A town band, like the old games**
- **A songbook, not a loop.** The music layer is a small generative composer: four authored tunes (two daytime folk songs, two night lullabies), each with A/B sections over real chord progressions, assembled into varying forms (A-A-B-A, A-B-A-A, ...) with a pickup bar and a ring-out outro. Repeated sections vary — the lead swaps timbre or adds a phrase-end flourish — and the next song is always a different tune.
- **Three console voices.** NES-style 25%/12.5% duty pulse leads and a flute tone (proper band-limited PeriodicWaves), plucked arpeggio/chord accompaniment, triangle bass in root–fifth motion — plus delayed-onset vibrato on held notes, downbeat accents, and humanized timing.
- **Arrangements follow the day.** Brisk and bright at noon, slower at dawn, warm and an octave lower at dusk, minor-pentatonic lullabies at night. When day turns to night mid-song, the tune finishes with its outro and the night songbook takes over. Storms push the music back and let the weather speak.
- **One tonal center.** Every pitched element — songs, bed swells, every bell cue — shares the same pentatonic tonal center per phase, so nothing ever clashes.

**The world you hear is the world you see**
- **Weather is audible.** Wind gusts with the storm intensity and hushes on calm days; rain patter and droplets track precipitation; thunder rolls just after each visible lightning strike. Winter snowfall stays hushed — wind carries the scene.
- **Time of day is audible.** A dawn chorus of birdsong, quieter daytime birds, and summer-night crickets (two of them, arguing in stereo) that go silent in winter.
- **The village is audible.** A faint work-hum of wood knocks and hammer taps scales with how many agents are working; an idle village rests near silence.

**Moments ring, but never spam**
- **Governed one-shot cues.** Arrivals and departures get two-note bells, distress a low muted toll, recovery a resolving pair, council gatherings a three-bell pattern, plus an hour bell (08:00–20:00) and a rare aurora shimmer.
- **A central cue governor** — per-kind cooldowns, 4-second global spacing, max 6 cues per minute — structurally prevents v0.12's wall-of-beeps from ever returning. Excess cues are dropped, never queued.

**BGM mode — continuous town music, like the handhelds**
- **A second sound system, switchable in the top bar.** The AMBIENT/BGM button (visible while sound is on) swaps the reactive soundscape for continuous town BGM in the classic handheld tradition: the music never stops. Choice persists across sessions.
- **Five original town themes** built from analysis of classic game BGM: *Willowbrook* (gentle home-village), *Cobblemarket* (warm market street over constant eighth-note arpeggios), *Millwheel* (brisk workday with soft hats), and after dark *Starfall* and *Moonwell* (slow music-box lullabies with pad chords and long echo).
- **Seamless loops, rotating playlist.** Pieces loop gap-free 2–3 times, take one short breath, and hand over to a different tune; time of day picks the playlist, and a day tune finishes its loop before the night music takes over. Event cues ring over the score like game jingles, ducking the music briefly.
- **Console voicing.** Pulse-wave lead (music-box bell at night), pulse arpeggio/counter voice, triangle bass, whisper-level noise percussion — the classic four-channel layout.

**Controls & plumbing**
- **Volume slider** next to the sound toggle, persisted across sessions.
- **Ambience continues in Dashboard mode** — the audio director computes its own local-clock atmosphere when the World renderer is stopped.
- New events: `atmosphere:updated` (renderer snapshot broadcast) and `weather:storm-flash` (per lightning strike). QA helpers: `__claudevilleAudio()` exposes per-layer levels, `setLayer`, `cue`, `setVolume`.

## v0.23.0 — *Tides & Torchlight* · Jul 12, 2026

A visual overhaul of the village: the harbor gets its beloved flock back, the water learns to move, the seasons touch the ground, hats finally sit on heads, and the night gets dark enough for lanterns to matter. Six exploration scouts surveyed the renderer; everything below is procedural canvas work — no new sprite assets.

**The harbor flock returns**
- **One ship per commit again.** Docked commits render as individual ships (up to 15 per repo, was: collapse into stack sprites at 5) — you can watch the fleet grow as an agent commits. Stack sprites remain only as overflow.
- **The whole flock sails on push.** Departing ships always render individually: a 12-commit push casts off as a 12-ship flotilla, with ±12% per-ship speed jitter, serpentine sway, and a beacon flare on the channel buoy at cast-off.
- **Flagship leader.** The lead ship keeps a commit-count class hull with the repo heraldry and a fleet-count `N⚓` banner; every other commit is a skiff.
- **Living hulls.** Ships bob and roll (phase-seeded per ship, so the flock never moves in lockstep), flags and pennants wave — streaming harder as ships pick up speed — and skiffs vary by hull mirror, gunwale stripe, and deck crates.

**Living water**
- **Rivers flow.** Downstream flow streaks derived from the river polylines' direction — rivers no longer read as static teal ribbons.
- **The sea rolls.** Swell crests travel across tiles along the wave direction instead of twinkling in place.
- **Sun and moon glitter.** A deterministic sparkle field on open water: warm at midday, pale blue under the moon.
- **Waterfalls churn.** Breathing spray mist, foam dabs, and staggered ripple rings at the plunge pool.
- **The horizon breathes.** Distant-sea swell lines bob and drift, with a glitter column under the sun/moon.

**Seasons & vegetation**
- **The ground knows the season.** Terrain rebakes per season: snow flecks in winter, wide warm leaf litter in autumn, blossom dabs in spring.
- **Leaves fall from trees.** Drift particles anchor to the world — leaves and petals spawn from actual tree canopies, butterflies from flower patches — instead of raining uniformly over open sea and rooftops.
- **Wind arrives in gusts.** Tree sway is modulated by a spatially-phased gust envelope, so wind travels across the forest in waves instead of a metronome.
- **Hidden details surfaced.** The terrain generator's stone and mushroom tiles (tagged but never drawn) now render: pebble clusters in open grass, glowing-cap mushrooms under the northern canopy.
- **Real insects.** Butterflies flap procedural wings; fireflies pulse with a soft halo.

**Hats that fit**
- **Per-cell head anchoring.** Accessories stamp at each sprite cell's measured head apex, tracking facing direction and walk bob — no more floating, sliding headgear (was: one fixed anchor for all 80 cells).
- **No more hat teleporting.** Tool-driven accessories switch only after 20s of dominance; effort crowns still apply instantly.
- **No more shrinking villagers.** Body draw-scale now measures accessory-free bounds, so a tall hat no longer squashes its wearer.
- **Grounded, harmonized headgear.** Contact shadow under the brim, palette-trim tint toward the wearer's colors, and a cropped darkened back view when facing away.

**Night, light & weather**
- **Real darkness.** The night/dusk grade composites with `multiply` instead of a milky translucent wash — deep contrasty nights, golden dawns.
- **Lanterns that glow.** Light stamps draw additively with a hot inner core, punching through the dark; the large-viewport fast path regains a capped glow pass (it previously dropped all lights exactly when zoomed in at night).
- **Torchlit decor.** Lantern and brazier props get warm flickering night glows; fireflies now only spawn at dusk/night, with extra spawn points by grass and water.
- **Weather with depth.** Rain falls in three parallax layers, splashes land on the ground instead of the sky, winter precipitation falls as snow, and a dozen hot stars twinkle live over the cached night sky.

---

## v0.22.0 — *Warden's Rounds* · Jul 10, 2026

The wardens swept every district of the village: a broad repo-wide survey (8 parallel review agents + a live-app UX pass) picked the highest-impact fixes and polish, all landed in one round.

**Security & data correctness**
- **Path-traversal fix.** Claude session-detail resolution now realpath-contains client-supplied ids; `sessionId=../../../../etc/…` can no longer read arbitrary `*.jsonl`-suffixed files.
- **Account email restored.** `claude auth status` now emits JSON; the usage service parses it (with plaintext fallback), so `/api/usage` reports the account email again.
- **Quota staleness cap.** After 30 minutes without a successful quota fetch, the API stops serving a frozen snapshot as live data — mine reserves and visit throttling degrade honestly.
- **Gemini tokens & pricing.** Gemini sessions now report token usage (previously always $0.00) and price against a real Gemini rate table instead of falling through to Claude Sonnet rates.
- **Reasoning-token billing parity.** The browser cost estimate now includes reasoning tokens exactly like the server, so TopBar totals match `/api/sessions`.
- **`git push --delete` detection.** Branch deletions (`--delete`, `-d`, `:branch`) are flagged as deletions instead of appearing as ordinary pushes.

**Multi-agent & provider coverage**
- **Grok subagents parented.** Sessions spawned by Grok orchestrators are marked `sub-agent` and linked to their parent via on-disk `subagents/<id>/meta.json` (37 previously-flat villagers now group correctly).
- **Codex `custom_tool_call` support.** Tool history and "last tool" now surface custom tool calls — no more "No tool usage yet" on active sessions.
- **No more ciphertext in the village.** Codex `spawn_agent`/`send_message` inputs are summarized to their routing target/task name; encrypted `gAAAA…` blobs no longer render in bubbles or cards.
- **Grok & DeepSeek badges.** Dashboard cards and sidebar icons show their own provider identity instead of falling back to the Claude badge; Grok gets its cyan hue in-world too.
- **`ultra` tier everywhere.** The last two gaps (hero-portrait aura, Activity Panel level label) now recognize the GPT-5.6 `ultra` effort tier.

**World & dashboard polish**
- **Readable crowds.** Speech/status bubbles de-collide in clusters: bubbles stack into free slots (max 3 per cluster) with deterministic priority; extras collapse to a quiet ellipsis dot.
- **Human tool labels.** Orchestration tools read as activities — *Messaging*, *Waiting On*, *Spawning*, *Coordinating* — instead of snake_case, and low-confidence bubbles no longer end in `!?`.
- **Unique villagers.** The fallback name pool grew from 15 to 64 village-flavored names with collision-aware assignment — no more twin Leibnizes.
- **Dashboard card tidy-up.** Meta chips truncate with ellipses instead of sliding under the status pill.
- **Quieter, cheaper client.** Detail polling pauses while the tab is hidden (instant refresh on return), the "Server connected" toast only fires on true reconnects, and World relationship tracking drops a 3×-per-frame array rebuild.
- **Grok sprites rebaked.** `agent.grok.base` and `agent.grok.composer` regenerated at higher quality in the same cosmic-truthseeker lore Grok chose — consistent outfit from every angle, crisp cyan rim light; fixes the composer sheet's baked-background artifact. KDE widget stills refreshed.

**Perf & docs**
- **Claude session scan bounded.** Orphan/team-member discovery caches per-project listings on directory mtime (was: stat every historical session file every poll).
- **Docs sweep.** README version/API table (`/api/changelog`), gpt-5.6 in the troubleshooting cost-model list.

---

## v0.21.0 — *Celestial Vanguard* · Jul 10, 2026

The GPT-5.6 generation marches through the gate as a celestial warrior triad — Sol the radiant sun-warlord, Terra the earth sentinel knight, and Luna the moonlit skirmisher.

- **GPT-5.6 model identities.** `gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-terra` / `gpt-5.6-luna` get first-class identities (labels, minimap colors, dashboard emblems, context window, pricing) instead of falling back to the GPT-5.4 battle-engineer sprite.
- **Three new warrior sprites (PixelLab pro).** `agent.codex.gpt56sol`, `agent.codex.gpt56terra`, and `agent.codex.gpt56luna` are full 8-direction walk/idle sheets with signature runtime weapons: dawn greatblade, earthbreaker warhammer, and crescent moon saber.
- **Ultra reasoning tier.** The new 6th effort level (`ultra`, Sol/Terra only) gets its own radiant star-crest head overlay, aura, dashboard crest, and label — above `max`.
- **Subagent variant inference.** Codex multi-agent v2 spawns record the parent's model on every child; the Codex adapter now infers the 5.6 variant from the orchestrator's task naming (`/root/luna_*`, `/root/terra_*`), so spawned Luna/Terra agents wear their own colors.
- **GPT-5.6 pricing.** Static rates per announced API pricing: Sol $5/$30, Terra $2.50/$15, Luna $1/$6 per 1M tokens.

---

## v0.20.0 — *Starfall Gate* · Jul 9, 2026

Grok agents walk into the village as cosmic truthseekers — void-black coats, electric cyan constellation trim, and a wry starfarer smirk.

- **Grok CLI provider.** New read-only adapter for `~/.grok/sessions/` (`summary.json`, `updates.jsonl`, `chat_history.jsonl`) with `grok-` session ids, live tool/message parsing, reasoning effort, context-window occupancy, and git-event extraction from shell tools.
- **Cosmic truthseeker identity.** Grok maps to the new sprite class (`agent.grok.base` / `agent.grok.composer`), cyan minimap color, effort floor rings, and xAI pricing rates for cost estimates when token splits exist.
- **Manifest + palette.** `manifest.yaml` and `palettes.yaml` gain the void/cyan Grok palette and character prompts.
- **Grok sprites (PixelLab pro).** `agent.grok.base` and `agent.grok.composer` are full 8-direction walk/idle sheets (void coat, cyan constellation trim / swift scout). A procedural fallback baker remains at `npm run sprites:generate-grok` if PixelLab is offline.

---

## v0.19.2 · Jun 29, 2026 — Hotfix

- **Dependency advisory cleared.** Dev tooling and the browser-vendored YAML parser now use `js-yaml` 4.3.0, closing the moderate Dependabot alert surfaced after GitHub security scanning was enabled.

---

## v0.19.1 · Jun 29, 2026 — Hotfix

- **Canonical repo note.** The README now states that `TokenBrice/claude-ville` is the active maintained repository while it remains a public fork of `honorstudio/claude-ville`.

---

## v0.19.0 — *Guild Charter* · Jun 29, 2026

ClaudeVille opens a clearer front gate for GitHub visitors, contributors, and security reporters.

- **Public README front door.** The README now leads with the local/read-only promise, supported providers, zero-build runtime, current version, changelog link, and simulator-backed screenshots instead of a fragile external attachment.
- **Community trust files.** MIT licensing, contribution guidance, support routing, a security policy, and a code of conduct now live at the repo root so GitHub can surface the project health signals directly.
- **Structured GitHub intake.** Issue forms, contact links, a pull request template, and area/provider/status labels route bugs, provider parsing reports, widget issues, visual regressions, docs fixes, and feature requests into useful lanes.
- **Repository discovery metadata.** Package metadata, GitHub topics, the repo description, discussions, Dependabot alerts, and private vulnerability reporting are now aligned with the active local-first AI coding CLI dashboard.

---

## v0.18.1 — *Steady Gaze* · Jun 22, 2026

The World idle camera trades cinematic cleverness for a sturdier village watch — slower, simpler, and focused on where agents naturally gather.

- **Central-agent focus.** Auto-camera now scores live villager positions every few seconds, favoring the agent most surrounded by nearby agents with only small bonuses for active work and attention states.
- **Patient movement.** Ordinary idle moves use broad frames, long dwell windows, slow glides, no long-jump bridge shots, and no automatic zoom-in.
- **Stronger user control.** Manual camera input, selected-agent context, follow mode, reduced motion, and the Cinema toggle now all gate automatic movement before the director can request a glide.
- **Event cues kept simple.** Incidents, arrivals, releases, and failed-push incidents still use boxed `village:camera-cue` targets, with longer cooldowns and the existing glide grade passed through.

---

## v0.18.0 — *Quiet Watch* · Jun 21, 2026

The World camera becomes a **patient village lookout** — calm when the town is calm, quick only when something needs attention, and always ready to frame the action without a hand on the controls.

- **Action-first idle framing.** The idle camera now scores incidents, waiting agents, release moments, handoffs, building activity, arrivals, departures, and working clusters, then picks the most meaningful place in the village to watch.
- **Calmer cinematic pacing.** Separate urgency profiles let incidents preempt quickly while ordinary work and ambient views dwell longer, so the idle experience feels relaxed instead of restless.
- **Gentler movement language.** The camera now prefers pans over unnecessary zooms, keeps action in a comfortable safe zone rather than dead centre, and uses wide bridge shots for long jumps across the map.
- **Soft follow with memory.** Once focused, the camera eases after active clusters at a low speed, while recent agent and building activity lingers briefly so important spots do not vanish the instant a session quiets down.
- **Clearer control.** The topbar toggle now describes the feature as an idle action camera that frames live action, matching what the automatic view actually does.

Collected from commits `94071c0` through `20127cb`.

---

## v0.17.1 — *The Ledger* · Jun 20, 2026

The town banner becomes **one cohesive ledger** — compact, legible, and quiet where it should be.

- **Brand block.** `ClaudeVille` leads; version, FPS, and a live-connection heartbeat now share one quiet meta line beneath the wordmark instead of three competing chips, giving the bar back its horizontal width.
- **One family at the centre.** Tokens / cost / time fold into a single segmented **ledger tag** built to match the working / idle / waiting status tag, and the metric values move to the legible data face (Departure Mono) so the numbers read first.
- **Less to read.** The redundant 5h / 7d quota chip leaves the bar — those figures already live in the mine and the OS widget — while the living activity rail and reconnect sweep stay.

---

## v0.17.0 — *Lanternlight* · Jun 20, 2026

The village becomes **one lit place, breathing with its fleet** — and every new flicker of light, motion, or colour is a true word about a real session. A 50-item visual upgrade, distilled by a design council and built in dependency-ordered, file-disjoint waves.

### Coherence — one village, under pressure

- **One palette.** A single colour authority in `theme.js` (building accents, status set, provider hues) now feeds the world overlays, council rings, harbor, avatars, and the dashboard — the World and Dashboard finally read as two windows onto the same town.
- **Value hierarchy + grade.** A mark governor keeps the busy scene legible (the one errored agent is never lost in a crowd of twenty-four), and every overlay now tints toward the time-of-day grade instead of floating "day-cold" over a dusk scene.

### The world, lit and honest

- **Dormant promises wired.** Values the engine already computed and threw away now drive the scene: building **beacons breathe** together, **puddles / roof-glint / water-warmth** follow the weather to the ground, building fire **reflects on the night lagoon**, and the **whole sky storms when the fleet struggles** and clears to gold when it's healthy.
- **Forge & archive glow.** Molten light spills from the forge onto the cobble yard; lamplight leaks from the archive doorway when reading is heavy. A **Pharos searchlight** sweeps faster and shifts amber→red as distress rises.

### Legible at a glance

- **Glyph badges** replace the always-dark name pills, busy buildings fold their crowds into a **status tally**, labels **fade by zoom & density**, and overflow crowds raise a **heraldic standard** instead of silently dropping agents.

### Alive

- **Real body language** (distressed hunches, tired slumps, proud uprights), **working rituals at all nine buildings**, drifting **chimney smoke**, **token-flow motes**, **animated surf**, **cloud-shadow parallax**, directional **dawn/dusk shadows**, idle **gossip clusters**, and **seabirds with intent**.

### Epic moments

- **Director-driven cinematic camera** (frames parades, incidents, arrivals; aborts instantly on input), a **session-driven storm** with forked lightning, an **error distress arc** to the watchtower, an **opening establishing shot**, and an idle **Ken-Burns drift**.

### Surface polish

- Dashboard **reskinned to the village house style** with district washes and status rails, a **selection echo** that lights the same agent across panel/card/sidebar, an Activity-Panel **hero portrait** and **director scene-log ribbon**, a **topbar activity rail**, and **felt connection-loss** chrome.

*Built via a council-designed plan ([`agents/claudeville-visual-upgrade-top-50.md`](agents/claudeville-visual-upgrade-top-50.md)) and an orchestrated, file-disjoint parallel build (23 waves). Runtime-verified — zero console errors across World and the 24-agent stress sim, `validate:quick` green; every motion feature ships a reduced-motion fallback. Per-item visual polish QA is ongoing.*

## v0.16.1 — *Moonlit Envoys* · Jun 19, 2026

Kimi's newer home is now part of the village, with its child agents and context usage visible alongside legacy Kimi sessions.

- **Kimi Code sessions** — ClaudeVille now scans `~/.kimi-code/` in addition to legacy `~/.kimi/`, reading indexed projects by session id or directory with `state.json` homedir and `config.update.cwd` fallbacks, main sessions, child agents, recent tools, user prompts, assistant messages, token usage, and git commit/push activity with tool-result success/failure metadata from the new wire format
- **Detail parity** — Kimi Code detail responses now carry the same resolved project path used by the session list, and recent tool rows include tool-result exit codes/stderr so failed shell commands get the same warning chips as Codex and OpenCode
- **Child-agent lineage** — Kimi Code `agents/<agent>/wire.jsonl` entries now appear as linked sub-agents, including nested child-to-child lineage from persisted `parentAgentId` metadata when Kimi provides it
- **Quiet parent continuity** — when a Kimi Code child agent is active but the main wire is quiet or missing, the main session remains visible with child-derived model/context metadata and parent detail lookups fall back to the newest child wire so sidebar grouping, tethers, and parent selection keep working
- **Context limits** — Kimi Code model config and per-session `config.update` aliases are read for context-window capacity, so session cards and details can show the same normalized token pressure as other providers before the first usage record arrives
- **Usage normalization** — Kimi Code `usage.record` token fields now tolerate both camelCase and snake_case spellings before being normalized into ClaudeVille's shared input/output/cache counters
- **Live config watching** — legacy Kimi and Kimi Code config files are now part of the watch set, so display-name and context-limit changes refresh through the same near-live path as session updates
- **Detail lookup hardening** — Kimi transcript details, indexed session directories, and child-detail fallback paths now verify resolved paths stay inside known Kimi session roots before reading or trusting them
- **Lunar Kimi look** — the Kimi villager sprite has been refreshed from a horned executor into a lunar oracle silhouette that better matches the provider's softer moonlit identity

## v0.16.0 — *Home Waters* · Jun 15, 2026

The village gains a memory of its **people** and its **place**: the bonds it has always quietly tracked become visible, and your repositories surface as named anchorages out in the harbor.

### Kith — relationships made visible

- **Kinship panel** — selecting a villager now shows a *Kinship* section listing their allies and acquaintances, warmest first: each bond shows a tier badge, the meetings / chats / shared-commits behind it, and how long since they last worked together. This surfaces the affinity the village already computed (and persisted across sessions) but never displayed.
- **Ally tethers** — when long-standing allies idle near one another in the world, a warm thread is drawn between them, the visible counterpart to the parent/child family tethers.

### Home — repos as harbor anchorages

- **Repo anchorages** — every active repository (one with a live agent, or with commit ships in the harbor) now gets a persistent **anchorage** in the harbor sea: a crest buoy in the repo's signature colour, a name label, and a softly tinted patch of water. Busy repos read as lit and lively; quiet ones dim. The harbor becomes a glanceable map of which projects are alive.
- **Overflow anchorage** — when more repos are active than the harbor has slots, the remainder fold into a single "+N" chip rather than being dropped silently.
- **House colours** — each villager on the mainland wears a faint ground ring in their repo's colour, tying the agents at the forge, archive, and mine back to their home waters offshore. Repo identity is a layer *over* the activity metaphor — agents still walk to buildings by what they are doing.

---

## v0.15.0 — *The Living Village* · Jun 15, 2026

A two-part release that makes Claudeville cohere *and* come alive: every landmark rebuilt to one art standard, then the world between them filled with flora, fauna, and a real coastline.

### Buildings — harmonized

Every building was rebuilt to one art standard — cool stone, slate-blue roofs, painterly shading, and a grounded base under each — so the village reads as one place instead of a patchwork.

- **Rebuilt landmarks** — the Task Board (now an open-air quest board, not a cottage), Code Forge (slate roof, glowing furnace), Token Mine (cyan ore veins on a proper isometric base, no more hexagon), Pharos Lighthouse (taller, cool stone, no more washed-out lilac), and Research Observatory (now grounded, with its live clock hands re-aligned) were regenerated to a new building style contract
- **Everything is grounded** — each building sits on a baked isometric base tile; nothing floats anymore
- **One rendering path** — buildings are now single-image sprites (the old tile-grid `composeGrid` system is retired), simpler to generate and validate
- **Single style source** — the sprite bake script reads its style and prompts from the manifest, so there is one source of truth
- Regenerated buildings no longer render inside a grey rectangle (their transparent backgrounds are keyed out)

### Atmosphere & life

The world between the buildings now feels alive and tended, and the island reads as a real coastline.

- **Living ground.** The grass between buildings is no longer a flat fill: a procedural micro-detail layer bakes pebble and soil flecks, moss into the cobble joints, leaf litter under the northern canopy, and worn dirt where grass meets the roads — with wildflowers dabbing the meadows in colour.
- **Flower meadows & gardens.** New flower-clump scatter blooms across the lived-in districts, plus cultivated plants — flower beds, planters, and hedges — framing the civic plaza, the gate avenue, and the workshop row.
- **Butterflies by day, fireflies by night.** Summer ambience now drifts butterflies over the village while the sun is up and fireflies after dark.
- **Songbirds & waterfowl.** Songbirds flit on looping paths between the trees of the inhabited belt; ducks paddle the calm lagoon and herons wade at the shoreline — the land and lagoon now carry the same life the open sea always had.
- **A real coastline.** Beyond the walls the flat void is gone: a distant sea now stretches to a hazy horizon, tinted to the time of day, so Claudeville sits on a coast rather than floating on nothing.
- **The wall, lit and overgrown.** The southern palisade gained mounted torches with warm light, trailing ivy, and shrubs at its footing; the gate is now framed by flanking fire-baskets.

### Fixes

- Clustered agent **name tags no longer overlap** — the label de-overlap was measuring each tag at ~60% of its real pill width, so neighbouring name pills collided on the same slot (e.g. two "RATE-LIMIT WATCH" tags mashing over the Mine). The width estimate now matches the rendered pill, so close tags stack onto clear, separated slots while distant ones stay put.

## v0.14.0 — *Deep Reserves* · Jun 15, 2026

The token limit indicator becomes a place in the world: the Token Mine now shows how much limit is left as ore in the ground, and the crowded top bar gets a slim chip in place of its twin progress bars.

- **Mine reserves** — the mine renders remaining 5-hour limit as a stockpile of glowing ore crystals over a five-segment gauge, across five tiers from brimming to depleted. More limit left means a richer, brighter mine; a depleted reserve raises a pulsing red warning (with a static reduced-motion fallback)
- **Slimmer top bar** — the twin 5H/7D quota progress bars collapse into a single compact chip that still reports both windows' usage (the familiar figures), colored by whichever window sits closest to its limit, so the readout stays available in Dashboard mode too
- **Top bar tidy** — the redundant subscription tier and message-count chips are removed, the working/idle/waiting counts merge into one segmented status tag, and the LIVE indicator tucks neatly under the ClaudeVille wordmark
- **Consistent signal** — the mine glow and the building signal label now speak in terms of reserves remaining rather than usage pressure

---

## v0.13.0 — *Hearthsong* · Jun 14, 2026

The village gets a calmer sonic backdrop. v0.12's per-event beeps are replaced by a gentle procedural ambience that stays local, opt-in, and off by default.

- **Gentle ambient bed** — the sound toggle now starts a small Web Audio graph with warm low pads, filtered air/water texture, and quiet bell tones. There are no samples, build steps, or external assets
- **No reactive pile-up** — agent updates, tool calls, and village scenes no longer spawn sounds, so busy sessions cannot turn into a wall of beeps or motifs
- **Safer audio lifecycle** — ambience fades in and out, pauses when the tab is hidden, resumes only after a user gesture, and keeps the top-bar opt-in behavior from v0.12

---

## v0.12.0 — *The Grand Faire* · Jun 14, 2026

ClaudeVille gets a village-wide stage manager. The world now turns routine CLI state into short readable scenes while keeping the app local, opt-in, and smooth.

- **Village Director** — a bounded scene controller now coordinates team huddles, handoff trails, arrival/departure sparks, incident rings, release parades, building signals, and work-driven weather nudges
- **Last-minute replay** — World mode can show the past 60 seconds of agent movement as lightweight trails, with `R` toggling the view and a quiet screen badge while replay is active
- **Inspectable buildings** — building mode now opens with a Signal panel that summarizes load, queues, inbound routes, recent tools, and Director events before the occupant and state rows
- **Buildings feel busier** — footprints pulse with load pips, while the mine, forge, command center, harbor, and watchtower gain status-specific markers driven by existing presence, quota, and harbor state
- **Optional sound** — the top bar adds an opt-in Web Audio toggle; audio stays off by default, waits for a user gesture, and plays subtle cues for agent and village events
- **Final polish** — label text snaps to whole pixels for crisper unzoomed rendering, and sidebar header type now respects the 10px legibility floor

---

## v0.11.0 — *Watchtower Bells* · Jun 14, 2026

The village gets clearer signals, richer dossiers, and faster world controls. This release combines the UI legibility pass with a full world/dashboard enhancement wave.

- **World signals sharpened** — waiting-for-user agents now read as amber `INPUT`, errored and rate-limited agents route to the watchtower, low-confidence tool bubbles show `?`, and mood posture adds subtle tired/proud body language
- **Keyboard world control** — Tab cycles agents, arrow keys pan, `+/-` zoom, `F` recenters, and `Esc` deselects in World mode
- **Activity panel deepens** — mood, last-active, PLAN/ACT mode, cache write, cache hit ratio, harbor logs, chronicle dossiers, team message edges, building purpose/capacity, and two-agent pin comparison are now visible
- **Dashboard attention chips** — cards show last-active age, non-zero tool exit codes, clickable parent lineage, and section health counts rate-limited / waiting-for-user sessions as attention
- **Village metaphors extended** — mine lore, winter snow, chronicler pilgrimages, status-colored crowd clusters, forge refactor monuments, and richer building semantics make state easier to read at a glance
- **World render economy** — reused spatial-pair scratch collections, cached water/shore visibility, throttled crowd summaries, and render-mode-aware ritual pose sync reduce hot-path work

---

## v0.10.0 — *Fair Hand* · Jun 14, 2026

A legibility and restraint pass across the whole interface. The pixel font stays where it belongs (the village, the brand), and the data you actually read gets a clear hand.

- **Two-face type system** — `Press Start 2P` is now the display/brand face only; a new self-hosted companion, **Departure Mono**, carries all dense data (panel values, tool history, messages, dashboard card bodies, the agent list). A fixed type scale enforces a 10px floor, so nothing renders sub-legible anymore
- **Design-token foundation** — shared surface, elevation, spacing, divider, and focus-ring tokens in `reset.css`; a single global focus ring replaces the inconsistent per-control styles
- **Lighter chrome** — removed the duplicated second decoration pass ("refinement layer" blocks) that every surface carried; topbar, sidebar, dashboard cards, and the activity panel now use one consistent, token-driven treatment
- **Activity panel rebuilt** — leads with one plain-language line of what the agent is doing; the rest of the journey (route, reservation, breadcrumb, goal) moves into a collapsed "More detail" disclosure. Redundant rows removed, consecutive-duplicate breadcrumbs collapsed, and raw reason codes suppressed. Meta and token cells use compact `label · value` rows
- **Topbar tiered** — one unified chip style; status badges read as primary, with FPS and version quieted into a calm tertiary cluster
- **Sidebar** — a live filter input plus collapsible grouping of workflow subagents (collapsed by default), and a far more legible agent list
- **Minimap removed** — the parchment overlay is gone; pan and zoom are unchanged, and the per-frame draw returns canvas budget
- **Toasts** no longer overlap the open activity panel

---

- **Markdown renderer** — inline parser in `TopBar` converts the changelog format to HTML (version chip, release name, date, bullet lists, bold/italic/code)
- **Version bumped** — `index.html` and `package.json` corrected from v0.1 to v0.9 to reflect actual project history
- **Agent docs** — `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` updated with a `## Changelog` section instructing agents to prepend an entry and update version locations before pushing
